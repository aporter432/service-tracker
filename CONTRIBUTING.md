## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- Docker (optional, for containerized development)
- Gmail API credentials (for full functionality)

### Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/service-tracker.git
cd service-tracker

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/aporter432/service-tracker.git
```

## Development Setup

### Automated Setup

```bash
# Run setup script
./scripts/setup.sh

# Or manually:
make setup
```

### Manual Setup

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements-prod.txt

# Create environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Initialize database
python3 -c "from orbcomm_tracker.database import Database; Database().create_tables()"
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

```bash
# Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit

# Install hooks
pre-commit install
```

## Making Changes

### Branch Strategy

```bash
# Create feature branch from develop
git checkout develop
git pull upstream develop
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Or for bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/issue-number-description
```

### Branch Naming

- Features: `feature/description`
- Bug fixes: `fix/issue-number-description`
- Documentation: `docs/description`
- Refactoring: `refactor/description`
- Tests: `test/description`

### Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```
type(scope): Brief description (max 50 chars)

More detailed explanation (wrap at 72 chars).
Include motivation for change and contrast with previous behavior.

Fixes #123
Refs #456
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
- `refactor`: Code restructuring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(parser): Add support for multi-day incidents

Implemented duration calculation for incidents spanning multiple days.
Updated parser to handle date arithmetic across day boundaries.

Fixes #42
```

```
fix(database): Prevent duplicate notifications

Added unique constraint on reference_number + status combination.
Improved error handling for constraint violations.

Refs #38
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
make test

# With coverage
make test-cov

# Specific test file
pytest tests/test_integration.py -v

# Specific test
pytest tests/test_integration.py::TestDatabaseIntegration::test_notification_lifecycle
```

### Writing Tests

**Unit Tests:**
```python
# tests/test_unit.py
def test_function_name():
    """Test description"""
    result = function_under_test(input)
    assert result == expected_output
```

**Integration Tests:**
```python
# tests/test_integration.py
@pytest.mark.integration
def test_full_workflow():
    """Test complete workflow"""
    # Setup
    # Execute
    # Assert
    # Cleanup
```

### Test Coverage

- Aim for 80%+ coverage on new code
- Critical paths must be tested
- Edge cases should be covered

```bash
# Check coverage
pytest --cov=orbcomm_tracker --cov-report=html
open htmlcov/index.html
```

## Code Style

### Python Style Guide

We follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) with these tools:

**Black** (auto-formatting):
```bash
make format
```

**isort** (import sorting):
```bash
isort .
```

**Flake8** (linting):
```bash
make lint
```

### Style Rules

- Max line length: 127 characters
- Use double quotes for strings
- Add docstrings to all public functions/classes
- Type hints recommended but not required

**Good:**
```python
def calculate_duration(start: datetime, end: datetime) -> int:
    """
    Calculate duration in minutes between two datetime objects.

    Args:
        start: Start datetime
        end: End datetime

    Returns:
        Duration in minutes
    """
    return int((end - start).total_seconds() / 60)
```

**Bad:**
```python
def calc_dur(s, e):
    return int((e - s).total_seconds() / 60)
```

### Documentation

- Add docstrings to all public APIs
- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Update DEPLOYMENT.md for deployment changes
- Add inline comments for complex logic
